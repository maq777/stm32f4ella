                Release 5.1 for Linux, MacOSX and Windows
===========================================================================

The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977, was the
most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.  Now you can enjoy
all of your favourite Atari 2600 games on your PC thanks to Stella!

Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator.  It allows you to play
all of your favourite Atari 2600 games again!  Stella was originally
developed for Linux by Bradford W. Mott, however, it has been ported to a
number of other platforms and is currently maintained by Stephen Anthony.
